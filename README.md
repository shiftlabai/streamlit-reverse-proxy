# Streamlit via NGINX

This repo contains the demo Streamlit app documented [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/create-an-app), running behind an NGINX reverse proxy.

To get started, install Docker and docker-compose (Docker for Mac includes docker-compose), then:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Now navigate to http://localhost:8080/
